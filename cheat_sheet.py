# This is a single file python cheat sheet for quick access reference.
#
# I had to strike a balance be completeness vs conciseness, so the scope is
# broadly "how to do x in python, if it's different to most other languages"
# and only covers basic, useful or interesting examples.
#
# I've called each section "chapter", so that a text find on "cha.." will show you
# all the sections.

# chapter SYNTAX BASICS
#

# Python uses indentation, in theory it doesn't matter what, so long as it's
# the same throughout the file. Use 4 spaces, not tabs, because it's convention
# and if we all stick to it, then you can copy other people's code without weird
# indentation errors because one chunk uses tabs and the other spaces!)

if True:
    do_somthing()
else:
    do_something_else()

# To carry over a line, use the back slash and indent it more than normal so you
# can tell it appart from normal indented code:
if some_really_long_conditional_statement and \
        some_really_long_conditional_statement:
    do_something()

# This doesn't apply to brackets (round or square), or items separated by commas:
my_list = [
        item1,
        item2,
        ]

#Add returning tuples

#
# chapter RUNNING SCRIPTS and COMMAND ARGS
#

# When you run a python file (by opening it) it will execute  all code at indentation 0.
# This will also happen when your file is imported by another file.
# To avoid this happening, you can test if this file is the main file being called,
# and only run stuff if that f

if __name__ == "__main__":
    call_to_some_function()

# To access the args you pass to a python script from the command line:

sys.argv

# To access the executing python file's directory:
path = os.path.dirname(__file__)

#
# chapter IMPORTING
#

# Modules are files, and these need to be found in one of the locations held in
# sys.path. Standard modules will be in the installation folder

from my_module import *
from my_module import SomeSpecificClassOrDefinition, AndAnother
import my_module as mm

# To reload a module:
reload(my_module)

#
# chapter VARIABLES
#

# Python is dynamically typed, ie a variable can change type, which isn't allowed in
# statically typed languages:

a = 'hello'
a = 1

# Functions can be assigned to variables too:

def my_function(x, y):
    return x + y

a = my_function(3, 4)
b = my_function

# Here a stored the return value 7, but b stored a reference to my_function (without calling it)
# It can be called a later time like so:

c = b(5, 6)

#And c would be 11. This is useful for managing variable behaviour.

#
# chapter STRINGS
#

"str".split() # splits a string into a list, breaking on white space.
"str".strip() # removes whitespace on either end

# interpolation

'say %s' % 'hello'
'say %s and %s' % ('hello', 'goodbye')


# Useful string constants:

string.ascii_lowercase # = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
or string.lowercase # locale dependant
string.ascii_uppercase
string.ascii_letters #combination of above
string.digits #The string '0123456789'

# Useful for checking other strings.

#

# chapter OOP CLASSES
#

#Inheriting from 'object' is how create a "new style" class, and should generally always do this.
def MyClass(object):

    watch_out_this_is_a_class_variable = 'the same for EVERY instance'

    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age #This is how you create an instance variable

     #instance methods need 'self' as the first parameter
    def my_function(self, x, y):
        print 'something'
        # this is how you call an instance method
        self.my_other_function(2, 3)


# Data attributes, or instance members by convention are initialised to a
# reasonable value in __init__()
# Like local variables however, they spring into existence when assigned, so
# using the above class, you can this:

c = MyClass(45)
c.some_new_variable = 66
print c.age
>>> 45
print c.some_new_variable
>>> 66

# Python has no function overloading, so you can only have one function with a name
# in the same class.
